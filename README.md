This project is an attempt to illustrate different methods of managing application state in React as of version 16.3
## React Context
Finally, version 16.3 of React brought a re-implementation of the Context API which had previously been marked as experimental and unstable. The [react-context](https://github.com/dfcook/todo-ui/tree/react-context) branch shows how it can be used to remove the need to pass props down through multiple levels of the application tree.
